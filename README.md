# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project


Steve would like to do a deeper dive into the analysis of stocks for his parents.  Since Steve is looking at multiple years, he needs a program that will allow him to look at all stocks during different years.  Steve is interested in the stock title, total volume and the return, so he can better guide his parents on their investment journey.

## Results

**The Code**

With the code that was given, we were assigned to edit (refactor) the code to work for the given data.  In order to get the new code, I had to create an index, create the three output arrays and make sure that for each loop, the ticker volume started at zero.
